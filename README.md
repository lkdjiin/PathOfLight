# Path of Light

[Work In Progress] A ray tracer based on the book «The Ray Tracer Challenge».

## Dependencies

- Julia >= 1.1.0

## Exploring the code

The book is full of the «Tuple» concept. As Julia already has a built-in type
with that name, I changed it to «Element».

For the same reason:

| Book            | Path of Light |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Tuple           | Element       |
| Vector          | Agent         |
| position        | location      |
| intersect       | intersects    |
